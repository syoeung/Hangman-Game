7th Homework Assignment for UCI Coding Bootcamp - Incorporate Firebase to host train arrival and departure data

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Setup

* We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GithHub Pages to host your finished site.

### Instructions

  * Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
  
  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

### Bonus (Extra Challenges)

* Consider updating your "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. This is significantly more challenging; only attempt this if you've completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping (and maybe create a second GitHub repo).

* Try adding `update` and `remove` buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).

* As a final challenge, make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. You'll need to read up on Firebase authentication for this bonus exercise.

Option Two: Hangman Game (Challenge - Recommended)




Watch the demo.
Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
Display the following on the page:
Press any key to get started!
Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).



If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.



Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.



Hangman Game Bonuses


Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.

HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.


Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.


Definitely talk with a TA or your instructor if you get tripped up during this challenge.
